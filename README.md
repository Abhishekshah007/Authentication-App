  - Problem Statement:
            
            Create a layout that shows Sign in and Registration page. It should make use of different layouts and components to achieve such designs.
            
  -   Language
        
          - Java
          - XML
          
  - Solution and Approch:
  
          - First, I get all the resources to make this app, like images, icons, and fonts, and after completing this, I build my first login page in constraint layout,
          or you can say drag and drop functionality, and after that, I use relative layout to build the registration page. I also try to minimise the redundancy, and
          for that, I create many entries in the value file so that I can use any of those values whenever I want, and after completing the design, I create the logic
          that checks whether the entry or input is wrong or unacceptable, and then I connect both pages with the intent method so they work in sync.
